# Focus Frontend Engineer Exercise

This is the frontend technical exercise for Focus Consulting.

Objectives:

- provide evidence of your coding ability and understanding of relevant stack
- create an efficient interviewing process based on early alignment on both sides

Technical Stack:

- Typescript

Each exercise is written in the form of a typical user story ticket; each part of the exercise is complete after all the acceptance criteria is met.

## Instructions

1. Complete reading through this README page.
1. Start the UI with `npm start`
1. The home page will include all the details of what needs to be completed 

## Styling

These exercises are not a test of design, so the majority of the effort should be spent on getting the functionality implemented. The repository is making use of [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) but you are welcome to bring in any UI library you are comfortable with.

## Relevant commands

- `npm install` : downloads all the dependencies for the app
- `npm start` : starts the frontend React app. Changes will cause a reload
- `npm run server` : starts the backend API.
